# CTA Project Remake

## Introduction

This is another attempt at an old school assignment after several semesters studying and improving my coding abilities. I will be using Python 3.11.0 as my programming language and I will be utilizing pandas for accessing data and DearPyGui for the GUI.

## Files

### CTAStops.csv

The CTAStops.csv file will be used to store information about each station. Information will include Name, Latitude and Longitude, and their respective positions on each of the CTA lines. This app is assuming bilateral travel, meaning that it won't care about the direction of travel.

### CTA.py

The CTA.py file will store the code used to run this project.
