# CTA Project Remake

## Introduction

This is another attempt at an old school assignment after several semesters studying and improving my coding abilities. I will be using Python 3.11.0 as my programming language and I will be utilizing pandas for accessing data and DearPyGui for the GUI.

For ease of use, the window will not be scalable

Multiple themes and fonts will be stored in the app in the future, and customizations will be stored in a JSON file

## Files

### Data

#### CTAStops.csv

The CTAStops.csv file will be used to store information about each station. Information will include Name, Latitude and Longitude, and their respective positions on each of the CTA lines. This app is assuming bilateral travel, meaning that it won't care about the direction of travel.

#### userData.json (does not work yet)

Location for where user preferences will be stored

### CTA.py

The CTA.py file will store the code used to run this project.

### fonts

A folder called fonts will hold all installed fonts to be used in the project, you can select which one is the default in the CTA.py file
